# Violin-Note-Flash-Cards

HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript
This is an app that I built to help my beginner students learn how to read music.
Flash cards are a great resource for learning notes. I usually teach the A string
first, then the E, then D, then G. This app allows them to pick which string they
want to learn, and presents them with images. They can click a note name, and they
are rewarded with confetti and a happy face. If they pick incorrectly, a sad face
appears and the app waits for them to try again.
